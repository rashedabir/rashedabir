### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently pursuing B.SC(Final Year) in Computer Science Engineering from Daffodil International University. I consider myself who is persistent, a quick learner, and loves problem-solving by using simple and scalable solutions. In my everyday life, I try to love reading a book, write different things, helping people, and coding as well. I also think about different sorts of people. That basically inspires me as a different aspect.
